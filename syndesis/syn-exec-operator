# Execute the syndesis operator in isolation
#
# When developing the syndesis operator, the following scripts provide the build sequence:
#
# 1. syn-compile-op       -> Compile the operator to check for syntax errors
# 2. syn-install-op            -> Install the operator and upload it
# 3. syn-exec-op             -> Execute the operator to create a running syndesis
