# 1. syn-compile-op       -> Compile the operator to check for syntax errors
# 2. syn-build-op            -> Build the operator and upload the new image
# 3. syn-deploy-op         -> Deploy an instance of the operator
# 4. syn-exec-op             -> Execute the operator to create a running syndesis
